      My name is Gonzalo Reynoso, but my friends call me Gon. I was born and
      live in Buenos Aires, and over time, I have delved into the world of web
      development, specializing in technologies such as Angular, Node.js, and
      WordPress.
      <strong>
        Currently, I am working with Laravel, where I have learned to manage
        routes, controllers, and Eloquent models, as well as implement booking
        systems, CRUD operations, and authentication for a pet grooming and shop
        platform.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy the learning process and am always open to new challenges. I am
      motivated by the idea of continuing to grow as a developer and applying my
      knowledge in projects that challenge me and allow me to improve. Every
      line of code is an opportunity to learn something new and take another
      step in my professional journey. ðŸš€
    </p>

      <strong>
        I am developing a project for a dog grooming store with online booking
        and a pet shop, using Laravel for the backend, using Tailwind for the
        design.
      </strong>
      I focus on building a well-structured and efficient system to manage appointments,
      products, and customer interactions.
